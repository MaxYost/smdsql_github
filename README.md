# Project Title

Investigate a Relational Database

# Description 

This project will query the Sakila DVD Rental database. SQL code is written to run SQL queries and answer interesting questions about the database. As part of the submission, SQL queries will be used to build visualizations to showcase the output of the queries.

# Directions

In this project, you will query the Sakila DVD Rental database. The Sakila Database holds information about a company that rents movie DVDs. For this project, you will be querying the database to gain an understanding of the customer base, such as what the patterns in movie watching are across different customer groups, how they compare on payment earnings, and how the stores compare in their performance. To assist you in the queries ahead, the schema for the DVD Rental database is provided below.

The project submission is a presentation, which will be reviewed, and for which you will need to Meet Expectations to pass. For the presentation component, you will create four slides. Each slide will:

Have a question of interest.
Have a supporting SQL query needed to answer the question.
Have a supporting visualization created using the final data of your SQL query that answers your question of interest.
You will submit your project at the end of the project lessons. Your project will include:

A set of slides with a question, visualization, and small summary on each slide.
A text file with your queries needed to answer each of the four questions.
The essentials of your project submission are discussed on the page labeled as Project Submission.
